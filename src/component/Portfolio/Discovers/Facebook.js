                        <p><br/>My goal with this project was to show my potential clients how react.js can display data without page refresh. I took the most common features of a facebook ready made app and prove my self that i can also build same frontend
                            view with react.js. . I paid close attention to details and made sure that all the colours, fonts and backgrounds matched each other.<br/><br/></p>
